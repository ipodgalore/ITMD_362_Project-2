# Project-2
This project was created by Simeon W.

I believe this website I've created contains good structure. The only thing that I wish I had done differently would be adding more color. However overall my progress through taking this class has given me a better understanding of how to structure code and by continued use of validating my code it gives me an idea of what good code is supposed to look like. Will definitly be using validators for future projects outside of class.
